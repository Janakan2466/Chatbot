This is a small project to understand Deep Learning, Tensorflow and other Python libraries to create an intelligent chatbot. I am hoping to integrate this feature with an upcoming project of mine. This Artificial Intelligent chatbot trains a 2 neuron layer model with inquiries and provides output from the highest probability. 

Further steps:
  I am planning to incorporate this chat bot in a native web application for a start-up company. 
  I am also planning on integrating this into a private discord server as a FAQ system.
