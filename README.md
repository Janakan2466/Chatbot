This is a small project to understand Deep Learning, Tensorflow and other Python libraries to create an intelligent chatbot. I am hoping to integrate this feature with an upcoming project of mine. This Artificial Intelligent chatbot trains a 2 neuron layer model with inquiries and provides output from the highest probability. The packages that were used are as follows: Numpy, Nltk, Tensorflow, Tflearn.

The JSON file contain various messages that are used (intents) to map the inputs and provide appropriate responses. In order to determine the root meaning behind the input sentences the Natual Language Took Kit proposed a stemmer function which reduces the vocabulary of the sentences that are input into out model.

Further steps:
  I am planning to incorporate this chat bot in a native web application for a start-up company. 
  I am also planning on integrating this into a private discord server as a FAQ system.
